    "In this example, we will annotate and visualize CRISPR-Cas systems in the cyanobacteria species Rippkaea orientalis. CRISPR-Cas is a widespread bacterial defense system, found in at least 50% of all known prokaryotic species. This system is significant in that it can be leveraged as a precision gene editing tool, an advancement that was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The genome of R. orientalis harbors two complete CRISPR-Cas loci (one chromosomal, and one extrachromosomal/plasmid).\n",

So, each candidate system will be about 20 kbp in length. Results are written to a single CSV file. Final candidate loci contain at least one putative Cas1 gene and one additional Cas gene.

Because we used a relatively permissive e-value threshhold of 0.001 when running BLAST, Opfi retained regions with very low sequence similarity to true CRISPR-Cas genes. In fact, these regions are likely not CRISPR-Cas loci at all. Using a lower e-value would likely eliminate these \"false positive\" systems, but Opfi also has additional functions for filtering out unlikely candidates _after_ the intial BLAST search. \n",

But on a more realistic dataset, needing to re-do the computationally expensive homology search could detrail a project. Since the optimal search parameters may not be known _a priori_, it can be better to do a permissive homology search initially, and then narrow down results later."
