# Contributing
Thank you for your interest in contributing to Opfi. Contribututions can take many forms, including:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Issues
Issues should be used to report problems or bugs with the library, to request new features, or to discuss potential changes before PRs are created.

Good bug reports have:

- A summary of the issue
- Specific steps to reproduce the problem, preferably in the form of code examples
- A description of expected behavior
- A description of actual behavior

## Pull Requests
In general, we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). This means that all changes happen through Pull Requests:

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Push changes to your fork
6. Open a PR in our repository and include a description of the changes and a reference to the issue the PR addresses

## Coding Style
Contributors should attempt to adhere to the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide when possible, although this is not currently strictly enforced. At a minimum, new contributions should follow a style that is consistent with the preexisting code base. 

## Testing
We use the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) framework for creating unit tests. Please write tests for any new code contributed to this project.
