    abstract = {Abstract Bacteria construct elaborate nanostructures, obtain nutrients and energy from diverse sources, synthesize complex molecules, and implement signal processing to react to their environment. These complex phenotypes require the coordinated action of multiple genes, which are often encoded in a contiguous region of the genome, referred to as a gene cluster. Gene clusters sometimes contain all of the genes necessary and sufficient for a particular function. As an evolutionary mechanism, gene clusters facilitate the horizontal transfer of the complete function between species. Here, we review recent work on a number of clusters whose functions are relevant to biotechnology. Engineering these clusters has been hindered by their regulatory complexity, the need to balance the expression of many genes, and a lack of tools to design and manipulate DNA at this scale. Advances in synthetic biology will enable the large-scale bottom-up engineering of the clusters to optimize their functions, wake up cryptic clusters, or to transfer them between organisms. Understanding and manipulating gene clusters will move towards an era of genome engineering, where multiple functions can be “mixed-and-matched” to create a designer organism.},

In recent years, genome mining has seen broad applications in identifying and characterizing new compounds as well as in metabolic engineering. Since 2011, the ‘antibiotics and secondary metabolite analysis shell—antiSMASH’ (https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org) has assisted researchers in this, both as a web server and a standalone tool. It has established itself as the most widely used tool for identifying and analysing biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in bacterial and fungal genome sequences. Here, we present an entirely redesigned and extended version 5 of antiSMASH. antiSMASH 5 adds detection rules for clusters encoding the biosynthesis of acyl-amino acids, β-lactones, fungal RiPPs, RaS-RiPPs, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, C-nucleosides, PPY-like ketones and lipolanthines. For type II polyketide synthase-encoding gene clusters, antiSMASH 5 now offers more detailed predictions. The HTML output visualization has been redesigned to improve the navigation and visual representation of annotations. We have again improved the runtime of analysis steps, making it possible to deliver comprehensive annotations for bacterial genomes within a few minutes. A new output file in the standard JavaScript object notation (JSON) format is aimed at downstream tools that process antiSMASH results programmatically.}",

The databases used for mining have been updated and extended with literature references and links to UniProt and NCBI. Additionally, we have included automated promoter and terminator prediction and the option to upload RNA expression data, which can be displayed along with the identified clusters. Further improvements include the annotation of the context genes, which is now based on a fast blast against the prokaryote part of the UniRef90 database, and the improved web-BLAST feature that dynamically loads structural data such as internal cross-linking from UniProt. Overall BAGEL4 provides the user with more information through a user-friendly web-interface which simplifies data evaluation. BAGEL4 is freely accessible at http://bagel4.molgenrug.nl.}",

    abstract = "{The rational discovery of new specialized metabolites by genome mining represents a very promising strategy in the quest for new bioactive molecules. Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a major class of natural product that derive from genetically encoded precursor peptides. However, RiPP gene clusters are particularly refractory to reliable bioinformatic predictions due to the absence of a common biosynthetic feature across all pathways. Here, we describe RiPPER, a new tool for the family-independent identification of RiPP precursor peptides and apply this methodology to search for novel thioamidated RiPPs in Actinobacteria. Until now, thioamidation was believed to be a rare post-translational modification, which is catalyzed by a pair of proteins (YcaO and TfuA) in Archaea. In Actinobacteria, the thioviridamide-like molecules are a family of cytotoxic RiPPs that feature multiple thioamides, which are proposed to be introduced by YcaO-TfuA proteins. Using RiPPER, we show that previously undescribed RiPP gene clusters encoding YcaO and TfuA proteins are widespread in Actinobacteria and encode a highly diverse landscape of precursor peptides that are predicted to make thioamidated RiPPs. To illustrate this strategy, we describe the first rational discovery of a new structural class of thioamidated natural products, the thiovarsolins from Streptomyces varsoviensis.}",

Here, we developed Generic Repeat Finder (GRF), a tool for genome-wide repeat detection based on fast, exhaustive numerical calculation algorithms integrated with optimized dynamic programming strategies. GRF sensitively identifies terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), terminal direct repeats (TDRs), and interspersed repeats that bear both inverted and direct repeats. GRF also detects DNA or RNA transposable elements characterized by these repeats in plant and animal genomes. For TIRs and TDRs, GRF identifies spacers in the middle and mismatches/insertions or deletions in terminal repeats, showing their alignment or base-pairing information. GRF helps improve the annotation for various DNA transposons and retrotransposons, such as miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs), long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, and non-LTR retrotransposons, including long interspersed nuclear elements and short interspersed nuclear elements in plants. We used GRF to perform TIR/TDR, interspersed-repeat, and MITE detection in several species, including Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), and mouse (Mus musculus). As a generic bioinformatics tool in repeat finding implemented as a parallelized C++ program, GRF was faster and more sensitive than the existing inverted repeat/MITE detection tools based on numerical approaches (i.e. detectIR and detectMITE) in Arabidopsis and mouse. GRF is more sensitive than Inverted Repeat Finder in TIR detection, LTR\_FINDER in short TDR detection (≤1,000 nt), and phRAIDER in interspersed repeat detection in Arabidopsis and rice.

Here, we expand the diversity of reported CAST systems via a bioinformatic search of metagenomic databases. We discover new architectures for all known CASTs, including novel arrangements of the Cascade effectors, new self-targeting modalities, and minimal V-K systems. We also describe new families of CASTs that have co-opted the Type I-C and Type IV CRISPR-Cas systems. Our search for non-Tn7 CASTs identifies putative candidates that co-opt Cas12a for horizontal gene transfer. These new systems shed light on how CRISPR systems have co-evolved with transposases and expand the programmable gene editing toolkit.Competing Interest StatementThe authors are co-inventors on patent applications filed based on this work.},
