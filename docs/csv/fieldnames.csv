index,field name,data type,description
0,Contig,string,ID/accession for the parent contig/genome sequence.
1,Loc_coordinates,string,Start and end position of the candidate locus (relative to the parent sequence).
2,Name,string,Feature name/label. This is will be identical to “Description” (index 8) if ``parse_descriptions`` is ``True``.
3,Coordinates,string,"Start and end position of this feature, relative to the parent sequence."
4,ORFID,string,"A unique ID given to this feature, primarily for internal use. Only applies to features that are genes."
5,Strand,signed int,Specifies if the feature was found in the forward (1) or backward (-1) direction. Only applied to features that are genes. 
6,Accession,string,ID/accession for the reference sequence that had the best alignment (by e-value) with this feature’s translated sequence.
7,E_val,float,The e-value score for the best alignment for this feature. 
8,Description,string,"A description of this putative feature, parsed from the defline of best aligned reference sequence."
9,Sequence,string,The (translated) amino acid sequence for this feature.
10,Bitscore,float,The bitscore for the best alignment for this feature. 
11,Rawscore,int,The raw score for the best alignment for this feature.
12,Aln_len,int,"The length of the best scoring alignment, in base pairs. "
13,Pident,float,The fraction of identical positions in the best alignment. 
14,Nident,int,The number of identical positions in the best alignment. 
15,Mismatch,int,The number of mismatched positions in the best alignment.
16,Positive,int,The number of positive-scoring matches in the best alignment. 
17,Gapopen,int,The number of gap openings.
18,Gaps,int,Total number of gaps in the alignment.
19,Ppos,float,Percentage of positive scoring matches. 
20,Qcovhsp,int,"Query coverage per HSP. That is, the fraction of the query (this feature’s translated amino acid sequence) that was covered in the best alignment. "
21,Contig_filename,string,The input data (genomic sequence(s)) file path.
