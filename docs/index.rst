Opfi
====

Welcome to the Opfi documentation site! Opfi is a modular, rule-based framework for creating gene cassette identification pipelines, particularly for large genomics or metagenomics datasets. 

Opfi is implemented entirely in Python, and can be downloaded from the Python package index. It consists of two major modules: Gene Finder, for discovery of novel gene cassettes, and Operon Analyzer, for rule-based filtering, deduplication, visualization, and re-annotation of systems identified by Gene Finder.
