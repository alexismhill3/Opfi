====

Welcome to the Opfi documentation site! Opfi is a modular, rule-based framework for creating gene cluster identification pipelines, particularly for large genomics or metagenomics datasets. 

Opfi is implemented entirely in Python, and can be downloaded with conda or the from the Python Package Index. It consists of two major modules: Gene Finder, for discovery of novel gene clusters, and Operon Analyzer, for rule-based filtering, deduplication, visualization, and re-annotation of systems identified by Gene Finder.
